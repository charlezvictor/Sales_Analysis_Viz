### Power BI Visualization Reporting Sales Analysis over time
---

## INTRODUCTION
A power BI project on sales analysis carried out to derive insights from previous year sales in order to make data driven decisions.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, but just a dummy dataset to showcase several functionalities of Power BI._ 
Dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/charlezvictor/Sales_Analysis_Viz/blob/main/Budget%20and%20Sales%20Data.xlsx)


## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
1.	Sales growth from year to year?
2.	How has revenue performed from year to year?
3.	Variance between budgeted sales and current sales?
4.	Current Sales increase per year and forecast in the next one year?
5.	Which product is performing well in the market?


## SKILLS / CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED
The following Power BI concepts were put in place
-	DAX
-	Quick measures
-	Data Modelling
-	Tooltips


## MODELLING
Power BI as it would usually do, automatically derived a relationship between tables which were accurate, but I needed to create another table to aid my analysis and thus appended the Data model to create a preferred Model, then from the model, I hid certain columns that wouldnâ€™t be necessary during analysis and report generating


Adjusted Model                  |       Preferred Model          |        Auto-Model
